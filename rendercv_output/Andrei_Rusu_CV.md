# Experience

## University of Southampton, PhD in Computer Science and Student Ambassador

- Sep. 2019 to Feb. 2024 
- Southampton, UK 
- Published two journal studies and an award-winning conference paper on data-driven epidemic modeling and control. Thesis: [An inquiry into diffusion processes over interaction networks](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/486201).
- Designed an efficient graph neural network architecture and a reinforcement learning pipeline to derive highly effective and explainable policies for testing, tracing, and vaccination in epidemics, increasing their simulated impact by margins of up to 50% when compared to standard strategies.
- Authored a research report on the potential of language models to be used in conjunction with system biology models to detect neoantigenic peptides for developing cancer vaccines.
- Mentored, supervised, and demonstrated labs for pupils, undergraduate and postgraduate students on several topics, including deep learning, data science and software engineering.

## Continental Automotive, Software Developer, Intern

- Jul. 2018 to Sep. 2018 
- Iasi, Romania 
- Contributed to a successful interdepartmental research project aimed at comparing the four major cloud providers in terms of their natural language understanding engines.
- Built an Android chatbot for drivers with Google Dialogflow and text-to-speech integration, capable of answering queries about the traffic, location or weather at 20% of the cost of other providers.

## J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Technology Analyst, Intern

- Jun. 2017 to Jun. 2018 
- London, UK 
- Worked alongside middle-office and traders to implement and maintain dependable risk management tools, some of which lead to 25% improvements in the reporting time.
- Acquired a clear understanding of OOP design and Agile workflows by developing features for the Kapital platform, a critical risk management system with hundreds of users.

## Akixi Ltd., Web and Java Developer, Intern

- Jun. 2016 to Sep. 2016 
- Crawley, UK 
- Developed a utility for on-demand compilation of JSP files, offering our users the option to generate personalized PDF documentation based on the help pages of our call reporting application.
- Created a platform for testing Java Servlet services that became widely used in the company, reducing the time spent on manual testing environment configuration by more than 30%.

# Education
